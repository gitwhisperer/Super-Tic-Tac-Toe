# Super Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a Super Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Python and Tkinter. The game consists of a 3x3 grid of smaller 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe boards. Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the smaller boards, and the goal is to win three smaller boards in a row, column, or diagonal.

This game was inspired by a video from the Vsauce YouTube channel. Check out their content [here](https://www.youtube.com/@Vsauce).
